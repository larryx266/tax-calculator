# Tax Calculator

Uses 2021 tax brackets for US federal and California state income tax. Allows
for the option to opt-in standard deductions during calculations. This application
only works for salaries that are more than $100,000, as the tax brackets below that
become much more intricate. Most of the code is actually writing to the file that 
ends up printing out all the calculations and tax info.
